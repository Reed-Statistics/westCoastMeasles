## West Coast Measles Data

 In this github we have created an R package for interacting with west_coast_measles, 
 a dataset we made by wrangling data from https://github.com/WSJ/measles-data. For an
 in-depth introduction to the usage of the package, please save and open blog/blog.html.
 Please note that although a blog/blog.rmd document has been provided, you will not be able
 to compile the example vizualization yourself without a google API key.
